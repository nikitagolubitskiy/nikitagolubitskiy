Hi,
Iâ€™m a software developer focused on building reliable and maintainable apps using Node.js, Ruby, Python, and Go. I'm passionate about computer graphics (WebGL, WebGPU, Metal) and I write my own low-level renderer to better understand how the graphics work. I also experiment with sound generation and basic digital signal processing (DSP).

Languages: JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, Python, C, Go, Haxe
